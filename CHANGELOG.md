## Version 1.0.4
- Interim version replaced by 1.0.5 on August 2016

## Version 1.0.3
- Align to a new BOND schema used by the Application Insights data collection endpoints.

## Version 1.0.2
- Prevent from overriding the instrumentation key using the one specified in the config when it's provided explicitly in code.
- Handle all successfull HTTP status codes and report the relevant HTTP Requests as successful.
- Handle all exceptions thrown by the ConfigurationFileLocator .

## Version 1.0.1
- The [Java agent](app-insights-java-agent.md) collects dependency information about the following:
    - HTTP calls made via HttpClient, OkHttp and RestTemplate (Spring).
    - Calls to Redis made via the Jedis client. When a configurable threshold is passed, the SDK will also fetch the call arguments.
    - JDBC calls made with Oracle DB and Apache Derby DB clients.
    - Support the 'executeBatch' query type for prepared statements – The SDK will show the statement with the number of batches.
    - Provide the query plan for JDBC clients that has support for that (MySql, PostgreSql) – The query plan is fetched only when a configurable threshold is crossed

## Version 1.0.0
- Adding support for the Application Insights writer plugin for CollectD.
- Adding support for the Application Insights Java agent.
- Fix for a compatibility issue with supporting HttpClient versions 4.2 and later.

## Version 0.9.6
- Make the Java SDK compatible with servlet v2.5 and HttpClient pre-v4.3.
- Adding support for Java EE interceptors.
- Removing redundant dependencies from the Logback appender.

## Version 0.9.5
- Fix for an issue where custom events are not correlated with Users/Sessions due to cookie parsing errors.
- Improved logic for resolving the location of the ApplicationInsights.xml configuration file.
- Anonymous User and Session cookies will not be generated on the server side. To implement user and session tracking for web apps, instrumentation with the JavaScript SDK is now required – cookies from the JavaScript SDK are still respected. Note that this change may cause a significant restatement of user and session counts as only user-originated sessions are being counted now.

## Version 0.9.4
- Support collecting performance counters from 32-bit Windows machines.
- Support manual tracking of dependencies using a new ```trackDependency``` method API.
- Ability to tag a telemetry item as synthetic, by adding a ```SyntheticSource``` property to the reported item.
