 * The class serves as the container of all {@link com.microsoft.applicationinsights.internal.perfcounter.PerformanceCounter}
 *
 * If there is a need for a performance counter, the user of this class should create an implementation of that interface
 * and then register it in this container.
 *
 * Note that the container will only start working after the first registration of a Performance Counter.
 * That means that setting the timeouts is only relevant if done before the first registration of a Performance Counter.
 *
 * The container will go through all the registered Performance Counters and will trigger their 'report' method.
 * By default the container will start reporting after 5 minutes and will continue doing so every 1 minute.
 *
 * The user of this class can add (register), remove (unregister) a performance counter while the container is working.
 *
 * The container will be stopped automatically when the application exists.
